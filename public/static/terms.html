<p>To be effective, the notification must be a written communication that includes the following:


<ol><li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</li>

<p>We may give notice to our users by means of a general notice on any of our websites, electronic mail to a user’s e-mail address in our records, or written communication sent by first-class mail to a user’s physical address in our records. If you receive such a notice, you may provide counter-notification in writing to the designated agent that includes the information below.

<h3>XII. Dispute Resolution and Class Action Waiver</h3>


<p>In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute (“dispute”) related to or arising out of your use of the Site, other than disputes related to or involving Bolt’s intellectual property, you and Bolt mutually agree to the following dispute resolution procedure:</p>


<ol><li>The parties will first attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute by informal negotiation. The informal negotiation period will begin when the party asserting the dispute sends a written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the dispute. If, after sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent, the parties have been unable to resolve the dispute, either party may commence binding arbitration. The parties may agree to extend the informal dispute resolution period by mutual written agreement.</li>
<li>If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through informal negotiation, you and Bolt agree that exclusive jurisdiction for the dispute shall be binding arbitration before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties. If the parties cannot agree on the selection of an Arbitrator, they shall each select one Arbitrator from the list of qualified JAMS arbitrators and those two Arbitrators shall select the person who shall serve as the Arbitrator for such dispute. Arbitration shall be initiated in the Washington, D.C., area, unless the parties mutually agree to an alternative location. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on any potential award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. BY USING THE SITE, YOU ARE HEREBY GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. Unless the arbitrator concludes that the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, Bolt will pay all filing, JAMS, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.</li>
<li>ALL DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. Neither party shall have the right to have a dispute heard as a class action and no arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the proceeding.</li></ol>


<h3>XIII. Choice of Law</h3>


<p>These Terms have been made in and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.</p>


<p>The parties acknowledge that this policy evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Policy shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16).</p>


<h3>XIV. Choice of Forum</h3>


<p>By using the Site, you agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute not subject to the arbitration provision discussed above shall be the state and federal courts located in the District of Columbia.</p>


<h3>XV. Indemnity</h3>


<p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Bolt, its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors and suppliers, from and against any and all losses, expenses, damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from any violation of these Terms or any activity related to your account (including negligent or wrongful conduct) by you or any other person accessing the Site using your account.</p>


<h3>XVI. Assignment</h3>


<p>In the event that all or part of our assets or sold or acquired by another party, or in the event of a merger, you grant us the right to assign the personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information collected via the Site.</p>


<h3>XVII. Severability</h3>


<p>In the event that any portion of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other portion of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect and be construed as if the invalid or unenforceable portion were not part of the Terms.</p>
