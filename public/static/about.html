    <h1>About Bolt</h1>
      <p>With each year hotter than the last, it’s becoming clearer every day that we need to change the way we produce and consume energy. And whether it’s electric cars or farm-to-table, companies and businesses are finding innovative new ways to help consumers reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the electricity industry is one area that has too often resisted consumers’ calls for more clean energy options. Utility monopolies and unresponsive regulators have discouraged innovation and stymied competition. But the status quo doesn’t have to be the only option.</p>
      <p>Bolt’s mission is to give every consumer the option to use 100 percent clean energy. We do this by empowering the grassroots innovators that are working every day to transform our electric grid: the community that comes together to build a shared solar farm, the community activist that masters complex energy regulations to help low-income families get access to clean energy, or the small business that is bringing solar to one community after another.</p>
      <p>We want to help these clean energy champions succeed. We do this by connecting consumers directly to clean energy developers so that they can buy clean energy right from the source. We also offer free web pages to community solar developers - think of it as your complimentary online storefront; a way to advertise your services and keep in touch with customers. And if you live somewhere without clean energy options, we encourage you to reach out to those developers who might be able to help you bring clean energy to your community.</p>
      <p>Together, we can bring clean energy to every community in the country and give every consumer the option to buy 100 clean, renewable electricity. Sign up for Bolt today.</p>

    <h1>What is Community Solar</h1>
    <p>Currently available in 25 states, community solar is one of the most exciting and transformative new ways to buy electricity.
    These projects allow consumers to “buy in” to a local renewable energy project even if they aren’t physically connected to the project.
    In many cases, your utility will “virtually” credit your monthly electric bill for your share of the project’s electricity generation.
    This means you can switch to clean, renewable solar energy without going through the hassle and expense of putting solar panels on your roof or in your yard.
    It also means that - for the first time - you can buy solar electricity even if you’re renting or living in a condo building.</p>
